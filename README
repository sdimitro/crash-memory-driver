# /dev/crash (with write support)

This repo contains the source code of the memory driver of the
crash utility. The only difference with the mainline repo is
that I've implemented writing to kernel memory through the driver,
in a similar fashion that you can read from kernel memory.

The original repo of the crash utility (including the memory driver)
can be found here: https://github.com/crash-utility/crash

== ORIGINAL README FILE KEPT BELOW ==

For live system analysis, the physical memory source must be one
of the following devices:

  /dev/mem
  /proc/kcore
  /dev/crash

If the live system kernel was configured with CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM
or CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY, then /dev/mem cannot be used. 

If the live system kernel was configured without CONFIG_PROC_KCORE,
or if /proc/kcore is non-functional, then /proc/kcore cannot be used.  

The third alternative is this /dev/crash driver.  Presuming that 
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build points to a kernel build tree or
kernel "devel" package tree, the module can simply be built and
installed like so:

  # make
  ...
  # insmod crash.ko

Once installed, the /dev/crash driver will be used by default for
live system crash sessions.
